       NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor
Christopher Waller said Thursday the central bank is effectively
at the ample reserve level, which suggests the central bank’s
balance sheet process may not have much more space to run.
    When it comes to the level of reserves that are needed in
the financial system, Waller said “we’re basically back to where
we think we should be” given the draw down of bond holdings. He
told a gathering held by the Council on Foreign Relations the
Fed’s next big balance sheet decision will be on the composition
of its holdings.

    By Michael S. Derby
       NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor
Christopher Waller said on Thursday he's on board with another
interest rate cut at the U.S. central bank's policy meeting
later this month because of the mixed readings on the state of
the job market.
    ""Based on all of the data we have on the labor market, I
believe that the (Fed's policy committee) should reduce the
policy rate another 25 basis points at our meeting that
concludes October 29,"" Waller said in the text of a speech to be
delivered before a gathering of the Council on Foreign Relations
in New York.
    What comes after that meeting, Waller said, depends on
future data. He said as he weighs whether more rate cuts are
needed, ""I will be looking for how the solid GDP data reconcile
with the softening labor market.""
Waller reiterated his view that trade tariffs are having a
modest impact on inflation and that price pressures remain on
track to hit the Fed's 2% target. That outlook allows the
central bank to focus policy deliberations on the job market.
    ""The broad message of all the labor market data is one of
weakening in demand, relative to supply, even with substantially
lower net immigration and a decline in labor force participation
this year,"" and as the Fed navigates this month's meeting
without major data due to the U.S. government shutdown, private
data are sending mixed signals about the state of hiring, he
said. Waller noted that data showing a low-hire, low-fire labor
market is ""ominous.""
    Waller explained that any signs of a pick-up in the job
market amid strong growth could slow the need for rate cuts.
    But, ""if the labor market continues to soften or even weaken
and inflation remains in check, then I believe the FOMC (Federal
Open Market Committee) should proceed to reduce the policy rate
toward a neutral level, which I judge is about 100 to 125 basis
points lower than it is today,"" implying a policy rate in the
2.75%-3.00% range.
    ""The labor market has been sending some clear warnings
lately, and we should be ready to act if those warnings are
validated by what we learn in the coming weeks and months,""
Waller said.
     
    US CENTRAL BANK EXPECTED TO CUT RATES THIS MONTH
Fed policymakers will meet on October 28-29 amid a dearth of
data due to the government shutdown. After the central bank
lowered its policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point to
the 4.00%-4.25% range last month, officials are broadly expected
to deliver the same-sized rate cut this month.
    The rate cuts are aimed at steadying a tottering job market
at a time when inflationary pressures still remain high and will
likely accelerate for a time as President Donald Trump's massive
and ever-shifting trade tariffs work their way through the
economy.
In comments on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested that
even as the central bank lacks the data that normally drive its
monetary policy deliberations, a looming rate cut is possible.
He said, ""based on the data that we do have, it is fair to say
that the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to
have changed much since our September meeting four weeks ago,""
adding that ""rising downside risks to employment have shifted
our assessment of the balance of risks.""
    Waller, who is in the running to succeed Powell when his
term as Fed chief ends next May, has been among the first wave
of officials supporting rate cuts, driven by a worry that the
job market is running out of gas and tariffs will cause a
one-time shift in price levels that the Fed can look through.
    Some Fed officials have been less sanguine about the
inflation outlook and more reluctant to cut rates, while others
concur that tariffs will present a transient risk to price
pressures. Officials at the Fed's September meeting penciled in
around half of a percentage point worth of rate cuts for the
remainder of this year.

    By Howard Schneider
       PHILADELPHIA, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. labor market
remained mired in its low-hiring, low-firing doldrums through
September, though the economy overall ""may be on a somewhat
firmer trajectory than expected,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome
Powell said on Tuesday, noting that policymakers will take a
""meeting-by-meeting"" approach to any further interest rate cuts
as they balance job market weakness with the fact that inflation
remains well above their 2% target.
""Based on the data that we do have, it is fair to say that the
outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have
changed much since our September meeting four weeks ago,"" at
which the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a
percentage point, Powell said in remarks prepared for delivery
at a National Association for Business Economics conference.
    ""Data available prior to the shutdown, however, show that
growth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer
trajectory than expected,"" he said in reference to the U.S.
government shutdown that has delayed release of jobs and other
data.
    ""There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate the
tension between our employment and inflation goals,"" Powell
said, noting the nearly even divide seen in recent policymaker
projections among those who see rate cuts at the policy meeting
later this month and at the one in December, and those who see
one or fewer cuts by the end of the year.
    Powell cautioned that those projections can evolve as new
data arrive.
    ""I will stress again that these projections should be
understood as representing a range of potential outcomes whose
probabilities evolve as new information informs our
meeting-by-meeting approach to policymaking,"" Powell said. ""We
will set policy based on the evolution of the economic outlook
and the balance of risks, rather than following a pre-determined
path.""
Even with the September jobs report delayed, Powell, who devoted
most of his remarks to a discussion of Fed balance-sheet policy,
said he drew from a variety of public and private data sources
for insight on the job market.
    ""While official employment data for September are delayed,
available evidence suggests that both layoffs and hiring remain
low, and that both households' perceptions of job availability
and firms' perceptions of hiring difficulty continue their
downward trajectories,"" Powell said.
The elevated inflation, he said, was partly due to rising goods
prices that ""primarily reflect tariffs rather than broader
inflationary pressures.""
    The Fed will receive an update on consumer price inflation
on October 24. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has been told
to release its latest Consumer Price Index report despite the
ongoing shutdown.
    The Fed will hold its next policy meeting on October 28-29,
with investors expecting it to reduce rates by another quarter
of a percentage point.

    By Michael S. Derby
       Oct 13 (Reuters) - In her first speech as head of the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve, Anna Paulson said on Monday that
rising risks to the job market argue for more interest rate cuts
by the U.S. central bank, as trade tariffs are unlikely to push
up inflation as much as expected.
    ""Given my views on tariffs and inflation, monetary policy
should be focused on balancing risks to maximum employment and
price stability, which means moving policy towards a more
neutral stance,"" Paulson said in the text of a speech to be
presented before a gathering of the National Association for
Business Economics in Philadelphia.
    ""Labor market risks do appear to be increasing - not
outrageously, but noticeably. And momentum seems to be going in
the wrong direction,"" so that now deserves to be the focus of
policy, she said.
    While Paulson did not say specifically how she'd like the
Fed to proceed with rate cuts, she noted, ""I view easing along
the lines"" of the forecasts released by the Fed at its policy
meetings last month as the likely way forward.  
The Fed last month cut its benchmark overnight interest rate by
a quarter of a percentage point to the 4.00%-4.25% range. It
also penciled in an additional half percentage point of easing
before the end of 2025 and more cuts next year and in 2027.
    Paulson said the recent rate cut ""made sense,"" as the
central bank sought to offset risks to the job market.
Paulson took the helm of the Philadelphia Fed in July,
succeeding Patrick Harker, who retired before returning to
academia. Prior to joining the Philadelphia Fed, she was
research director at the Chicago Fed.
In recent comments, Fed officials have been grappling with the
monetary policy outlook. While the recent rate cut had broad
support, a number of policymakers remain worried that President
Donald Trump's tariffs will drive up still-high inflation
levels, while others are worried about the job market and
believe the Fed should act strongly to support it.
    Paulson said tariffs should push up inflation, but added
that she doesn't expect the gains to be persistent. She also
said the current ""modestly restrictive"" stance of monetary
policy is working to tamp down on inflation pressures, while
noting that stable readings of long-term inflation expectations
argue against the expectation of a persistent rise in price
pressures.
    But Paulson also cautioned against a go-fast approach to
cutting interest rates, given uncertainty around where the
so-called neutral level of monetary policy lies.
    Looking ahead, she said ""I anticipate that 2026 will see
growth near potential, and inflation rising and then subsiding
as tariffs, together with current and past monetary policy
restrictiveness, work their way through.""
    Paulson added that ""if the economy evolves as I expect, the
monetary policy adjustments we make this year and next will be
sufficient to keep labor market conditions close to full
employment.""

"BARR: FED’S INFLATION GOAL FACES SIGNIFICANT RISKS, BUT ALSO SOME FACTORS THAT MIGHT MITIGATE THOSE RISKS",urn:newsml:reuters.com:20251009:nS0N3UJ0CB:3,2025-10-09 16:45:19+00:00,"Oct 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. central bank should move
cautiously on further interest rate cuts, Federal Reserve
Governor Michael Barr said on Thursday in a speech that leaned
heavily into the risks of inflation, even as he acknowledged the
potential vulnerabilities in a ""roughly balanced"" labor market.
    ""The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) should be cautious
about adjusting policy so that we can gather further data,
update our forecasts, and better assess the balance of risks,""
Barr said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Economic Club
of Minnesota, his first on monetary policy since June.
    With both upside inflation risks and downside risks to the
labor market, the Fed is in a ""challenging position"" with no
risk-free path forward as it sets monetary policy, Barr said,
explicitly borrowing the way Fed Chair Jerome Powell phrased the
central bank's current quandary. 
    Barr said he supported the Fed's
quarter-of-a-percentage-point reduction to the policy rate last
month, but he focused many of his comments on the risks that
tariffs pose to inflation, suggesting he is not sold on the need
for a series of rate cuts, as financial markets currently
expect. 
    Barr said he forecasts underlying inflation by the Fed's key
measure, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index,
to rise to above 3% by the end of this year, and noted that Fed
officials do not expect headline inflation to fall to the
central bank's 2% goal until the end of 2027. That would be the
longest period of PCE inflation above 2% since a seven-year
stretch that ended in 1993, he said.
    ""After the high inflation Americans have endured, two more
years would be a long time to wait for a return to our target,
and that possibility weighs on my judgment for appropriate
monetary policy,"" he said.

    By Michael S. Derby
       NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Americans grew more worried
about the future of the job market in September, while at the
same time bumping up projections for the future path of
near-term inflation, a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York said on Tuesday.
    Respondents to the bank’s latest Survey of Consumer
Expectations marked up expectations that overall unemployment
will be higher in a year relative to August, amid a rise in the
expected probability of losing one’s job. But respondents also
see better odds of finding new work in the next three months in
the event of an unexpected job loss.
    Concern about the future of the job market came as
households viewed their current financial situations more
favorably while downgrading “slightly” where they see themselves
in a year, the bank said. As of September, households reported a
cutback in future spending expectations amid mixed views on
future earnings and income levels.
    Meanwhile, the report also found in September that the
expected level of inflation a year from now stands at 3.4% from
August’s 3.2%, while three-year-ahead expected inflation held
steady at 3%. September’s five-year-ahead expected inflation
reading also stood at 3% from the prior month’s 2.9%. The Fed’s
inflation target is 2% and actual inflation readings have
exceeded that level for several years.
    The September report also noted that year-ahead food price
expectations rose to their highest level since March 2023.
    
    DATA DESERT
    The New York Fed report, which is most closely watched for
its readings on the expected path of inflation, may garner
elevated interest amid the absence of economic data tied to the
government shutdown. The survey, which ran over the month of
September, was completed before the shutdown took effect.
    The dearth of data means that as Fed officials approach
their policy meeting at the end of the month, they do so without
the usual range of statistics critical to driving policy
deliberations. Officials have already missed what should have
been the release of the September employment report on Friday.
    The Fed cut its overnight target rate range last month by a
quarter percentage point to between 4% and 4.25% and it is
expected to do so again at the Federal Open Market Committee
meeting scheduled for October 28-29. Analysts foresee another
easing because privately produced data continues to point to
weakness in hiring, and offsetting the risk of job market
deterioration was a key reason why the central bank cut rates in
September.
    The challenge for Fed officials is that they are lowering
the cost of short-term borrowing at a time when inflation
remains above target and is expected to accelerate over the
remainder of the year as President Donald Trump’s tariff surge
works its way through prices.
    Fed officials have noted that even with a rate cut, the
overall level of short-term rates is still weighing on the
economy and countering inflation. And while a number of
policymakers remain skeptical of the need for further cuts, a
number have acknowledged that the impact on inflation from
tariffs has not been as bad as they were expecting.
    Speaking on September 29, New York Fed President John
Williams said “we have a balancing act here"" between getting
inflation down and supporting a job market that ""has been
gradually softening over the past year."" He also noted, “the
tariff effects have been smaller than most people thought, and
there doesn't seem to be any signs of inflationary pressures
building.""
    Meanwhile, Boston Fed leader Susan Collins said in an
interview on September 30 that while more rate cuts are
possible, easing “too quickly and certainly announcing, oh yeah,
we're just going to…keep going until we get to neutral, that
seems to me to be a scenario where the risks to inflation go
up.”

       Oct 3 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of New York
President John Williams said Friday that unpredictable change is
inevitable and central banks need to be aware of that and have
strategies to operate in those environments.
    Williams' comments, which came in prepared remarks for an
event in Amsterdam, did not address the outlook for U.S.
monetary policy. Williams serves as vice chair of the
rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which cut interest
rates last month as officials sought to offset rising risks to
the job market.
    “Unpredictable change and uncertainty will certainly
continue to be with us for the foreseeable future,” Williams
said, flagging issues like “the effects of ongoing global
demographic shifts, artificial intelligence, and potentially
transformative innovations in our financial systems.”
    Williams said dealing with uncertainty means that central
banks need robust principles and strategies in place that can
deal with a range of contingencies, while noting there will
still be novel situations to deal with. Williams also said that
formerly unconventional strategies like bond buying are no
longer novel and are a normal part of the toolkit.
    Williams said anchoring inflation expectations is critical
and cannot be taken for granted.

       BENGALURU, October 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar, under
pressure since the start of the year, may struggle to find its
footing against most major currencies over the coming 12 months,
according to a Reuters poll of FX strategists who said the
already crowded short U.S. dollar trade will remain.
Against the backdrop of rising U.S. fiscal deficit and worries
that the Federal Reserve's independence was eroding, global
investors have dumped the dollar for other major currencies and
assets like gold <XAU=> which has surged more than 47% this
year, setting record highs, on safe-haven demand.
    ""The U.S. fiscal situation is this ongoing 800-pound gorilla
of the markets, that special status means you can’t just go into
other currencies - you go into gold,"" said John Hardy, head of
FX strategy at Saxo Bank.
    ""Gold is telling you what people think of fiscal
pressure...people recognize nobody has a clean shirt. Everyone’s
running on a dirty shirt.""
This has weakened the greenback by about 10% for the year, a
trend expected to continue as the Fed is forecast to ease policy
further to stave off weakness in the labour market. Meanwhile,
the European Central Bank is likely done with cutting interest
rates.  
U.S. non-farm payrolls increased only 22,000 in August. While a
separate Reuters poll showed the world's largest economy
probably created 50,000 jobs in September, the U.S. government
shutdown which came into effect on Wednesday will delay the jobs
report markets were eagerly waiting for.
    Still, the overall outlook for the dollar was to stay weak
in the near term.
    ""I'd probably stay out of the dollar unless I'm being
tactical,"" said Dan Tobon, head of G10 FX strategy at Citi.
    A near 75% majority of analysts, 30 of 41, who answered a
separate question in the Reuters September 26-October 1 poll
expected the net short dollar position to increase or the
current positioning to not change much by the end of October.
     Latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed the short-dollar trade which began in April of this year
was firmly in place.
    ""The dollar can weaken further over the next six to 12
months as the Fed continues to cut rates while other major
central banks like the ECB indicate they're close to or at the
end of their rate cycle,"" said Lee Hardman, senior currency
analyst at MUFG.
    ""The dollar weakened a bit in response to the shutdown, but
in terms of the big picture I don't think it changes a great
deal. For now, I think the market's just got to assume its
status quo and the Fed will remain on track to cut rates at the
end of this month, even if they don't have data over the next
week or two to analyze.""
On September 17 the Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate by
25 basis points to 4.00%-4.25% and indicated more cuts would
follow at meetings in October and December.
    Interest rate futures are pricing in a 95% chance of a cut
in October, per the CME FedWatch Tool.
    The poll of nearly 80 forex strategists showed the dollar
weakening against all major currencies over the next three, six
and 12 months.
    A more than 70% majority of analysts, 33 of 45, who answered
an additional question said the U.S. dollar was more likely to
end 2025 weaker than they expected rather than stronger. Twelve
said stronger.
    The euro <EUR=>, which has gained more than 13% against the
dollar for the year, was expected to strengthen 1.5%-3.0% to
trade around $1.19, $1.20 and $1.21 in the next three, six and
12 months respectively.
    Among other major currencies, the Japanese yen <JPY=> was
predicted to gain around 6% in a year to 139/dollar and the
Aussie and the Kiwi dollars were expected to gain about
4.0%-6.0%.
